# Simple Army Editor

A web based army roster editor. I built it for my Warhammer 40,000 armies but it is generic enough to work for other games.

Goals:

* Entry is done by typing.
* The editor has no knowledge of particular units, points values etc. - you'll have to look those up in the book. It does make it easy to add stuff up though.

A live version of the editor is available at http://roster.ordoacerbus.com
