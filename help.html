      How to use the Army Editor
    </h1>
    <p>
      The army editor is entirely controlled by typing text in the editor box on the left side of the page. As you type, it 
      interprets the text and formats the army list on the right side of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <em>doesn't</em> know the rules, units or points costs of your game - you have to type those in.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Indentation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Indentation, that is the number of spaces at the start of each line, controls how each line is interpreted.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>No spaces</dt>
      <dd>Detachment (e.g. Battalion). The editor doesn't have any knowledge of what detachments are - you need to type the name.</dd>
      <dt>1 space</dt>
      <dd>Battlefield roles (e.g. Heavy Support). Again, the editor doesn't know what roles are - you need to type the name.</dd>
      <dt>2 spaces</dt>
      <dd>Unit (e.g. Tactical Squad). You need to type in the unit type, and you'll probably want to include points cost and number of models (see below).</dd>
      <dt>3 spaces</dt>
      <dd>Unit option (e.g. Flamer). You need to type in what the option is, and you'll probably want to include points cost and number taken.</dd>
      <dt>4+ spaces</dt>
      <dd>Now you're entering into the unknown!</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>
      Points costs
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can include a points value in any line by typing a number inside square brackets. (Normally you would only do this on unit or option lines)
    </p>
    <p>
      You can include a multiplier in a line by typing 'x' followed by a number. This would indicate the number of models or options taken. This only makes
      sense on a line with a points value in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
      <pre>
  Infantry Squad [7] x5
   Flamethrower [12]
      </pre>
      This describes an Infantry Squad. It has 5 models costing 7 points each, plus 1 Flamethrower which costs 12 points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army editor finds all the points costs in your list, multiplies and adds them up, and displays totals as you type.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Headers
  </h2>
  <p>
    A line which starts with some number of '#' characters is turned into a heading. You can put one anywhere but it mostly only makes sense at the 
    top of the list. The heading size depends on the number of '#'.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Annotations
  </h2>
  <p>
    A line which contains a ':' is turned into italic text. This is useful for adding notes to detachments or units. 
  </p>
  <h2>
    <em>Advanced</em> - Styling
  </h2>
  <p>
    You can add custom CSS formatting to your roster. Start a line with '!' followed by a selector and rules in curly brackets. Due to limitations
    of the editor (or laziness on my part) each selector + rules must be on a single line.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rules are automatically scoped to only apply to the display/print parts of the editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, these rules will attempt to put detachments in two columns:
    <pre>
! .detachment { width: 49%; float: left; }
! .totalrow {clear: both; width: 98%; }
! .detachment.drop1 {margin-top:0;}
    </pre>
  </p>
  <h1>
    Printing
  </h1>
  <p>
    Use the 'print' command on your browser to print the roster. It will only print the formatted display, not the editor. I like to adjust the 
    scaling in my print options to fit the list neatly onto pages.
  </p>
  <h1>
    Saving and Loading
  </h1>
  <p>
    The army editor uses local storage in the browser to remember the list you're working on. If you come back to the page it will show the last list you
    were in.
  </p>
  <p>
    To save a list outside of the browser, select all of the text in the editor, copy it, and paste it into a text file on your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly to load a list, copy all the text from a text file you saved previously, and paste it into the army editor.
